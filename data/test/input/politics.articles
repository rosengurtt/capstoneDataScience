The proposal would see the UK match EU trade tariffs temporarily in order to avoid a hard Irish border post-Brexit.

Brexiteers want to ensure the backstop could not continue indefinitely.

Responding on Twitter, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier set out the criteria on which he would judge the UK's proposal, including the need for a "workable solution" to avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland.

The European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt went further, saying it was "difficult to see" how this could be achieved.

"A backstop that is temporary is not a backstop, unless the definitive arrangement is the same as the backstop," he added.

Reality check: Brexit backstop proposals
The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, and the government is trying to make progress before a crucial meeting of EU leaders later this month.

BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Davis had "pushed back very hard" against the proposals on Wednesday and had two meetings with the prime minister on Thursday before a deal was agreed.

After the publication, Mr Davis's chief of staff said there had been a "helpful dialogue" and that the document had now been "clarified and amended".

According to the document - which has yet to be agreed with the EU - the "temporary customs arrangement", if it is needed, would be "time-limited".

A long-term "future customs arrangement" will be in place "by the end of December 2021 at the latest", it says.

Another cabinet Brexiteer Liam Fox, who also met the prime minister on Thursday, told the BBC: "As everybody knows from the referendum, opinions and feelings run high on this issue but we've shown we can reach an agreement civilly and collectively."

Who's the real winner?
David Davis is the victor of the hour, it seems, writes BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg.

The Brexit secretary threatened to quit the government if the prime minister refused to change her proposal to fix the customs conundrum - after he demanded a time limit on the "backstop", the insurance policy for avoiding a hard Irish border if trade talks break down.

There is a date in the document that is now on its way to Brussels.

What is the customs 'backstop' issue?
The UK has said it will leave the EU's customs union, which allows trade within the EU without any tariffs or many border checks.

The UK and the EU are yet to agree how trade in goods will operate after Brexit - but they have said that a "backstop" option is needed in case no deal is done, or the technology is not ready in time, to avoid the return of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

The UK has said that the EU's initial "backstop" proposal - effectively keeping Northern Ireland in the customs union - would create what amounted to a border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK and was not acceptable.

Instead, the UK is proposing a backup plan which would see the whole of the UK temporarily aligned with the EU's customs union after December 2020 - when the 21-month post-Brexit transition period ends.

The plan, which Theresa May has said would only apply in a "limited set of circumstances", would see the UK match EU tariffs in order to avoid border checks.

Corbyn likens Brexit to trains 'shambles'

What are Brexiteers worried about?
With the EU sceptical about the two options the UK has suggested to replace its membership of the customs union - and government ministers yet to agree which one to pursue - the backstop is "rapidly becoming the only option on the table", former Brexit minister David Jones told the BBC, "so it must be got right".

He said not having a firm time limit would be "damaging to the country": "It would tie us effectively into the the EU's customs arrangement for an indefinite period".

It would prevent the UK from having its own independent trade policy, he said - customs union members are not allowed to strike their own international trade deals.

It would also mean the UK was still under the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, which would be unacceptable to most Conservative MPs, he added.

 Jeremy Corbyn has compared Theresa May's handling of Brexit with the "shambles" in the UK railways as they clashed at Prime Minister's Questions.

The Labour leader said key documents, including the blueprint for future EU relations, had been "delayed" while customs proposals had been "cancelled".

But Mrs May said she was delivering on the 2016 referendum result while Mr Corbyn was trying to "frustrate" it.

It comes amid claims of cabinet tension over post-Brexit customs plans.

The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there were concerns the latest plans on the customs backstop - what happens if there is no free trade deal or customs arrangements ready by the end of the transition period in December 2020 - would, in effect, mean the UK never leaving.

There were specific objections among Brexiteers, she said, that while the document says there should be a time limit on closer ties to the EU, it doesn't say either what that time limit should be, or whose decisions it will be to say when time is up.

Pressed on the issue at Prime Minister's Questions, Mrs May insisted that the UK would leave the EU, as planned, in March 2019 and the 21-month transition period - or what she has described as an implementation phase - would end in December 2020.

But Mr Corbyn said the PM's Tory colleagues were not "all as one" with her on that.



Sources who have seen the four page customs backstop document tell me that it is "anodyne", that it is like Hotel California, where the UK checks out and never leaves - essentially, it's not up to snuff.

The specific objections are that while the document says that there should be a time limit on closer ties to the EU, it doesn't say either what that time limit should be, or whose decisions it will be to say when time is up.

The document merely says that the backstop will "only be in place until the future customs arrangement can be introduced".

For Brexiteers, the lack of a firm deadline is hard to swallow. Secondly, there is what has been described as a fudge on the European court.

Mr Corbyn said the negotiations were in chaos, with no cabinet agreement on a customs framework and a promised document setting out the UK's negotiating position on trade and other issues "no where to be seen" ahead of a crucial EU summit later this month.

"When it comes to Brexit, this government has delivered more delays and more cancellations than Northern Rail," he said.

"The government's white paper is delayed, its customs proposals have been cancelled and it has ripped up its own timetable just like our shambolic privatised railways."

But Mrs May said Labour was standing in the way of progress on withdrawal despite voting to trigger exit talks. "Since then, they have tried to frustrate Brexit at every stage," she said.

She called on the Labour leader to rule out another Brexit referendum and said next week's votes on the EU Withdrawal Bill - on which the government faces potential defeat on a customs union and the question of a decisive parliamentary vote on the final deal - would "test the sincerity" of MPs to leaving the EU.

Mrs May also came under pressure from Tory MPs, with Crawley MP Henry Smith saying his constituents wanted her to get on with both Brexit and sorting out the rail mess.

 “I never advise people what to do. I am not a great believer in telling other people what to do. They can do what they like really."



"Wow," gushed a European journalist to me the other day, "normally we look to Italy for political drama and uncertainty but the UK is making a pretty good show of it."

So dizzying and confused is the news coming out of the UK about how the EU-UK relationship could and should work after Brexit, that EU negotiators say they are forced to stand on the sidelines while the British government talks and argues with itself.

"It just can't work," an EU diplomat told me in exasperation this week. "Theresa May has so many nooses dangling around her neck that one of those nooses is sure to hang her."


Britain's GOV.UK portal has been online since Netscape Navigator 2.0 was state of the art. Now, a National Archives project to make this trove of historical content more accessible has shifted 22 years worth of government websites to the cloud, re-indexed and made searchable through its updated UK Government Web Archive.

The archive consists entirely of historic, publicly available web content, so you're not likely to turn up any unexpected state secrets. However, it provides valuable historical insight into the changing policies and attitudes of Britain's official government communications, and there's a trove of information to be found for anyone with an interest in the finer detail of government publications.

For example, a search for Brexit reveals 19,043 results, the first of which is a 2014 upload of a higher education funding presentation originally produced in April 2013, three months after then-Prime Minister David Cameron announced that the government would hold a referendum on EU membership.

There's plenty to read on the subject of climate change, starting in 1996, when the GOV.UK records begin, with a single Environment Agency press release on water management, which notes that "the results of research into the impacts of climate change are being studied by the Agency to assess their impact on water resource yields." In 2016, by comparison, the term got 1,141,844 exact matches in archived documents.



The archive is particularly valuable when it comes to seeing how modern historical events were communicated at the time, with materials including the September 2002 publication of the Iraq Dossier, which spurred the 2003 invasion of the country with claims – later proved false – that it possessed weapons of mass destruction.

Preserving history
Making this new archive wasn't easy. Over a period of two weeks, 120TB of the British government's archived GOV.UK web data was transferred from 72 individual two-terabyte hard disks to a pair of physical AWS Snowball transfer devices before being dispatched to one of Amazon's UK cloud storage facilities, where The National Archives' websites and content are hosted.

The operation, carried out by Manchester-based archiving firm MirrorWeb, involved a pair of specially built PCs that could have eight drives connected to them simultaneously, allowing data from 16 drives at a time to be decrypted and re-encrypted for transit on the Snowballs when they were finally shipped to Amazon's UK data centre.

The next step was to build a brand new search index and interface for the huge cache of data – a total of 1.4 billion documents ranging from PDFs to social media posts and web pages with ageing embedded multimedia elements. Everything had to be indexed and fully text searchable, and that meant that MirrorWeb had to develop new tools.

"We attempted to use traditional Hadoop tooling but found it to be impractical for big data sets stored in the cloud," explains MirrorWeb CTO Philip Clegg. "We decided to develop our own cloud native solution that scales linearly and enabled us to index over 147,000,000 documents per hour."

It did the trick. "To index the entire 120TB collection they were able to spin up 1,000 node plus cluster of computers to process the entirety of that collection, and in just a couple of days,” adds John Sheridan, digital director of The National Archives.

And the archive is set to keep growing. MirrorWeb is currently developing new crawlers to spider government content, including machine learning and AI to handle automatic content discovery and the patching of problematic site content.

What's missing?
The new archive isn't quite as comprehensive as the curious might hope. For example, although the government's official social media channels have been archived, the Twitter archives only go up to March 8, 2016, which means we couldn't look for the Foreign Office's hastily deleted claim that Porton Down had identified the use of a "military-grade Novichok nerve agent" in the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March of this year.

By comparison, archives of official government sites such as Your Vote Matters date from as recently as 2018.

MirrorWeb's Philip Clegg says that that the discrepancy is because "all archives have to go through Quality Assurance (QA) prior approval by the government before release to the public facing archive."

Given that GOV.UK's official deletion policy means that content can be removed if it "was published by mistake" or "if it could result in a risk to health, finances or reputation", it's probably safe to bet that we won't be seeing any official return of that compromising tweet.

Interactive content proved to be somewhat hit and miss, an issue which the National Archive acknowledges. While examples of early Macromedia Shockwave games such as those on the Environment Agency's 2002 edutainment site tried to load, the content was either missing or incompatible with recent versions of Adobe's Shockwave player.

That's going to change, though. Clegg says that the ultimate plan is to "achieve ultimate fidelity, including legacy plug-ins and software not supported by modern browsers," which is a vital and often-ignored aspect of archiving the ephemeral and vanishing history of the web.
