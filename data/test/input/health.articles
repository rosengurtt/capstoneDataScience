The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said some commonly-prescribed medicines were "controlled drugs" in certain countries.

In Japan, some cold remedies are banned while some sleeping pills require a licence in Singapore.

Travellers could risk a fine or even imprisonment if they break the rules, the FCO said.

The Foreign Office said it was becoming more popular to travel to countries further afield.

But according to a survey of 2,000 adults in the UK, only 33% of them would seek advice on medication rules before they travel.

Nearly half the population of the UK is on prescribed medication, meaning that around 21 million people could be risking difficulties.

Banned in Japan
Medication containing pseudoephedrine - found in over-the-counter medicines like Sudafed and Vicks - is banned in Japan.

And in Qatar, over-the-counter medicines such as cold and cough remedies are controlled substances and must be accompanied by a prescription.

Diazepam, Tramadol, codeine and a number of other commonly-prescribed medicines count as "controlled drugs" so the advice is to check the regulations in the country you wish to visit.

Failing to comply may result in arrest, a fine or imprisonment in many countries, including Greece and the UAE.

Other notable restrictions include:

sleeping pills, anti-anxiety pills and strong painkillers require a licence in Singapore
Costa Rica and China require visitors to bring a doctor's note with their prescribed medication
in Costa Rica, you should only take enough medication for the length of your stay, with a doctor's note to confirm that this is the right amount
in Indonesia, many prescription medicines such as codeine, sleeping pills and treatments for ADHD are illegal
tourists should always carry a doctor's note with any personal medicine when visiting China
The FCO said anyone travelling this summer should visit their GP at least four to six weeks before their holiday to check if any of their prescribed medication contained "controlled drugs" such as codeine.

Human rights campaigners have lost a Supreme Court appeal over the legality of Northern Ireland's abortion law.

The court dismissed an appeal brought by the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission (NIHRC).

But a majority of judges said the existing law was incompatible with human rights law in cases of fatal foetal abnormality and sexual crime.

Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland.

Currently, a termination is only permitted in Northern Ireland if a woman's life is at risk or if there is a risk of permanent and serious damage to her mental or physical health.

The commission lost on the issue of whether they had the required standing to bring the case, and analysts suggest the defeat came because of a technical legal point.

What a bizarre set of circumstances.

On the one hand, the case was dismissed while, on the other, a majority of Supreme Court judges said that Northern Ireland's abortion law is not compatible with human rights.

So where does that leave Northern Ireland?

While the case's dismissal means the government is not obliged to change the law, the seven judges have given a strong nod that reform is needed.

 A very clear message from the Supreme Court to all politicians in Westminster and NI - action is now required over NI’s abortion law which court ruled is incompatible with human rights legislation. @BBCNewsNI

Is this a victory for those who want change? They would argue so, because a majority of judges said the state of the law is "deeply unsatisfactory". Those are significant words.

However, those who argue the law should stay the same will take comfort that the majority of judges agreed the NIHRC didn't have the right to bring the case.

While a clear-cut decision would have been welcomed, that hasn't happened. For those at the heart of this - women and medics - the dilemma remains.

The Supreme Court judges said it would have required the case to have been brought by a woman who was pregnant as a result of sexual crime or who was carrying a foetus with a fatal abnormality.

A fatal foetal abnormality diagnosis means doctors believe an unborn child has a terminal condition and will die in the womb or shortly after birth, although anti-abortion campaigners have argued that terminally-ill babies "can and do defy the odds".

As a result, the judges did not make a formal declaration of incompatibility, which would normally lead to a change in the law.

The ruling comes just weeks after the Republic of Ireland voted decisively in a referendum to reform the country's strict abortion laws, which had effectively banned all terminations.

The referendum reignited a debate about Northern Ireland's law, with some calling for reform while others - including the biggest party, the Democratic Unionist Party - remain opposed to changing the law.


The NICHR had argued that the current law subjects women to "inhuman and degrading" treatment, causing "physical and mental torture," in violation of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR).

Lord Kerr said that, by a majority of five to two: "The court has expressed the clear view that the law of Northern Ireland on abortion is incompatible with article 8 of the Convention in relation to cases of fatal foetal abnormality and by a majority of four to three that it is also incompatible with that article in cases of rape and incest".

He added that while this was not a binding decision, "it must nevertheless be worthy of close consideration by those" who decide the law.

Any change in the law will now be up to the politicians, either in Belfast or Westminster.

Northern Ireland has been without an executive since January 2017, when the governing parties - the DUP and Sinn Féin - split in a bitter row over a flawed green energy scheme.

Prime Minister Theresa May has previously said that a government in Northern Ireland should deal with the issue.

Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley, responding to an urgent question in the House of Commons, said the government is "carefully considering" the judgement.

"The analysis and comments from the court on the issue of incompatibility will be clearly heard by this house and politicians in Northern Ireland," she said.

Les Allamby, from NIHRC, said it was "disappointed" at the ruling but that it fell to the UK government to change Northern Ireland's law "without delay".

Grainne Taggart, from Amnesty International, said the ruling was a "very important and long overdue vindication of women's rights in Northern Ireland".

"All eyes are now on Theresa May and her government. She cannot allow women in Northern Ireland to suffer on her watch," she added.

Fellow campaigner Sarah Ewart said she was "extremely relieved that the court recognised there has been a breach of human rights for women who go through a situation of a fatal foetal abnormality".


Media caption'Westminster should not interfere'
Ms Ewart has campaigned for a change to Northern Ireland's law in cases of fatal foetal abnormality after she travelled to England for an abortion in 2013 after being told her unborn child would not survive outside the womb.

Peter Lynas, from anti-abortion group Both Lives Matter said he welcomed the ruling and the recognition in the judgement that there is no right to abortion based on serious foetal malformation.

The case is the latest in a long line of legal challenges to Northern Ireland's abortion law.

Figures released on Thursday morning show that 919 women travelled from Northern Ireland to England for an abortion last year, a rise from 724 in 2016.

As many as one in five people who underwent a tonsillectomy went on to suffer from serious diseases they would otherwise not have developed, the study showed.

Experts have said the 30-year research, which involved nearly two million children, indicates that while the modest benefits of the operation - preventing a recurring sore throat - mostly vanish by the age of 40, it boosts the lifetime risk of serious conditions.

They believe that removing the tonsils in the first decade of life may harm the development of the immune system and open the door to future disease.

Published in the Journal of the American Association of Medicine, the study urges paediatricians to limit their use of tonsillectomies as far as possible.

Numbers of the procedure have been dropping since a high of around 200,000 a year in the 1950s, to less than 50,000 today.

Led by scientists at the University of Copenhagen, the research team analysed data from 1,189,061 Danish children born between 1979 and 1999 who had undergone a tonsillectomy in their first nine years.

The procedure was associated with an almost tripled risk, moving the chances of developing asthma, influenza, pneumonia or Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disorder (COPD), the umbrella term for conditions like chronic bronchitis and emphysema, to 18.6 per cent.


They also looked at the risks of having adenoids removed in childhood to treat recurrent middle ear infections.

This was found to be linked to a more than doubled risk of COPD, while nearly doubling the risk of upper respiratory tract diseases and conjunctivitis.

“Our observed results that show increased risks for long-term diseases after surgery support delaying tonsil and adenoid removal if possible, which could aid normal immune system development in childhood and reduce these possible later-life disease risks,” said Dr Sean Byers, who took part in the research at the University of Melbourne.

"As we uncover more about the function of immune tissues and the lifelong consequences of their removal, especially during sensitive ages when the body is developing.”

Previous research has indicated that these surgeries may also be heightening the risk of breast cancer and heart attacks.

The researchers wrote: “Given that tonsils and adenoids are part of the lymphatic system and play a key role both in normal development of the immune system and in pathogen screening during childhood and early life, it is not surprising that their removal may impair pathogen detection and increase risk of later respiratory and infectious diseases.”

The study found that adenoidectomy was associated with a significantly reduced risk for sleep disorders and both surgeries were associated with significantly reduced risk for tonsillitis and chronic tonsillitis, because the organs had been removed.

However, there was no change in abnormal breathing up to the age of 30 for any surgery and no change in sinusitis after tonsillectomy or adenoidectomy.

Mr Tim Mitchell, a consultant otolaryngologist from the Royal College of Surgeons, said:  “Before opting to remove tonsils or adenoids, surgeons will always consider and discuss all treatment options, including non-surgical treatments, with patients, and parents in the case of children.

"There has been a significant decrease in the number of tonsillectomies and adenoidectomies performed in the last few decades. The decision to operate will always be taken with good reason and based on proven benefit.” 

Experts say further research is needed to rule out the possibility that patients more inclined towards tonsil pain in childhood are naturally at higher risk of serious respiratory disease.
